Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. He developed the theory of relativity, which revolutionized modern physics. Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which provided evidence for the quantum theory.

He moved to the United States in 1933 to escape the rise of the Nazi regime. Later, he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1955, Einstein passed away, leaving a legacy that continues to influence science and technology.
