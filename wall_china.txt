The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built as early as the 7th century BC, with later joined sections making the wall stronger. Particularly famous is the wall built by the Ming dynasty (1368â€“1644).

Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Wall also served as a transportation corridor.

Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history. The wall's overall length, including all its branches, measures 21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles). In 1987, UNESCO designated the Great Wall a World Heritage site.
