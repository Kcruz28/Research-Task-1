Article: The Evolution and Impact of Cars
Cars, also called automobiles, are vehicles with wheels that carry a small number of passengers and are powered by an engine or motor. Before cars existed, people had to live close to their work, but cars made it possible to live farther away and travel easily within cities or even across continents. The first true automobile was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769; it had three wheels and was powered by steam, but it was heavy and slow. In the late 1800s, inventors experimented with steam, electric, and gasoline engines. Electric cars were smooth and easy to operate but needed frequent recharging, while gasoline engines proved more reliable and became the standard.

The first successful gasoline-powered car in the United States was built by Charles and J. Frank Duryea in 1893. The invention of the assembly line by Henry Ford in 1913 made cars much faster and cheaper to produce, making them affordable for many people. Fordâ€™s Model T became especially popular. As cars became common, they changed society by giving people more freedom, creating new jobs, and leading to the development of roads, gas stations, and other services. Over time, cars have continued to evolve with new technologies, safety features, and alternative fuels.
